You must answer at least 4 questions, but the remaining ones are optional. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: I think wrapIndex was very clever and made the simpler.

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: Apart from add first the code I wrote was the same as the staff solution.  

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: Add first method was not very elegant compare to what I have seen in the solution.

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing ArrayDeque?

A: I noticed that all of my group members implemented the add first and remove first method the same as I did with slight variations.

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A: I wish that I knew how useful the mod operator is. 

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: I would definitely use the mod operator to create some sort of index wrapper function.

LinkedListDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: 

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: My code was almost similar to the staff solution.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: I think I could have added more functionalities to my Node class to avoid repeated code in LinkedListDeque class.

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing LinkedListDeque?

A: I wondered that pretty much all my partners implemented LinkedListDeque the same as the staff solution.There were slight variations, but the overall functionality was the same.

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing LinkedListDeque, if anything?

A: I wish I had added more functionalities to my Node class to prevent repetitive code. Specially add node in a an index or remove a node from an index. 

Q: If you wrote LinkedListDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: I would created a more sophisticated Node class that would cut the need of repeated code in LinkedListDeque.

Meta:

Q: Did you like this design review process? Anything we should do differently next time?

A: I liked it the way it is.
